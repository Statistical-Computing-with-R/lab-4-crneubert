## The Data

In this lab we're going look at the median weekly cost of childcare in California. A detailed description of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md).

The data come to us from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

**0. Load the appropriate libraries and the data.**

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)

childcare_costs <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/childcare_costs.csv')

counties <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/counties.csv')

glimpse(childcare_costs)
```

**1. Briefly describe the dataset (\~ 4 sentences). What information does it contain?**

The dataset contains data on childcare prices by provider type, age of children, and their county's characteristics. The data comes from the National Database of Childcare Prices and ranges from the years 2008 to 2018. There are 61 variables present over 34567 observations.

## California Childcare Costs

Let's start by focusing only on California.

**2. Create a `ca_childcare` dataset of childcare costs in California, containing (1) county information and (2) all information from the `childcare_costs` dataset.** *Hint: There are 58 counties in CA and 11 years in the dataset. Therefore, your new dataset should have 53 x 11 = 638 observations.*

```{r}
#| label: ca-childcare-costs

ca_childcare <- inner_join(counties,
                           childcare_costs,
                           by = join_by(county_fips_code == county_fips_code)) |>
  filter(state_name == "California")

```

**3. Using a function from the `forcats` package, complete the code below to create a new variable where each county is categorized into one of the [10 Census regions](https://census.ca.gov/regions/) in California. Use the Region description (from the plot), not the Region number.**\
*Hint: This is probably a good place to use ChatGPT to reduce on tedious work. But you do need to know how to prompt ChatGPT to make it useful!*

```{r}
#| label: recoding-county-to-census-regions

ca_childcare <- ca_childcare |> 
  mutate(region = fct_collapse(county_name, 
      "Superior California" = c("Butte County", "Colusa County", "El Dorado County", "Glenn County", "Lassen County", "Modoc County", "Nevada County", "Placer County", "Plumas County", "Sacramento County", "Shasta County", "Sierra County", "Siskiyou County", "Sutter County", "Tehama County", "Yolo County", "Yuba County"),
    "North Coast" = c("Del Norte County", "Humboldt County", "Lake County", "Mendocino County", "Napa County", "Sonoma County", "Trinity County"),
    "San Francisco Bay Area" = c("Alameda County", "Contra Costa County", "Marin County", "San Francisco County", "San Mateo County", "Santa Clara County", "Solano County"),
    "Southern San Joaquin Valley" = c("Alpine County", "Amador County", "Calaveras County", "Madera County", "Mariposa County", "Merced County", "Mono County", "San Joaquin County", "Stanislaus County", "Tuolumne County"),
    "Central Coast" = c("Monterey County", "San Benito County", "San Luis Obispo County", "Santa Barbara County", "Santa Cruz County", "Ventura County"),
    "Southern San Joaquin Valley" = c("Fresno County", "Inyo County", "Kern County", "Kings County", "Tulare County"),
    "United Region" = c("Riverside County", "San Bernardino County"),
    "Los Angeles County" = c("Los Angeles County"),
    "Orange County" = c("Orange County"),
    "San Diego - Tropical" = c("Imperial County", "San Diego County")
  ))

# Gave DeepSeek the image of California regions and instructed it to separate each county into the vectors above

```

**4. Let's consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018. The cells should contain the `median` of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the `region` and the `study_year`. Arrange the rows by 2018 values.**

```{r}
#| label: median-income-by-region-over-time

median_household_income <- ca_childcare |>
  select(region,
         mhi_2018, 
         study_year) |>
  filter(study_year %in% c(2008, 2018)) |>
  group_by(region,
           study_year) |>
  summarise(median_median_income = median(mhi_2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = study_year,
              values_from = median_median_income) |>
  arrange('2018')

```

**5. Which California `region` had the lowest `median` full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this `region` correspond to the `region` with the lowest `median` income in 2018 that you found in Q4?**\
*Hint: The code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution.*

```{r}
#| label: lowest-median-weekly-price-2018
lowest_median_weekly_price <- ca_childcare |>
  select(region, study_year, mcsa) |>
  filter(study_year == 2018) |>
  group_by(region) |>
  summarise(median_price = median(mcsa)) |>
  slice_min(median_price)

print(lowest_median_weekly_price)

```

The region with the lowest median full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018 was the North Coast. This region does correspond to the lowest median income in 2018 as the North Coast also had the lowest value for that statistic as well.

**6. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.**

ca_long_sorted <- ca_childcare |>
  select(mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool, study_year, region) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c("mc_infant",
                        "mc_toddler",
                        "mc_preschool"),
               names_to = "care_type",

  mutate(care_type = factor(care_type, levels = c("mc_infant",
                                                  "mc_toddler",
                                                  "mc_preschool")))

                       y = median_full_price,
                       color = region)) +

          legend.text = element_text(size = 6),
          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6),
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)) +
    labs(x = "Study Year",
         y = " ",
         title = "Weekly Median Price for Center-Based Childcare ($)",
         color = "California Region")

```

## Median Household Income vs. Childcare Costs for Infants

**7. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) and the full-time median weekly price charged for center-based childcare for an infant in California. Overlay a linear regression line (lm) to show the trend.**

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot-median-income-vs-childcare-cost

ca_childcare |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mcsa,
                       y = mhi_2018)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Full-time Median weekly Price Charged for Center-Based Childcare for an Infant ($)",
       y = "Median Household Income (2018 Dollars)")

```

**8. Look up the documentation for `lm()` and fit a linear regression model to the relationship shown in your plot above.**

```{r}
# complete the code provided
reg_mod1 <- lm(ca_childcare$mcsa ~ ca_childcare$mhi_2018)
summary(reg_mod1)
```

**9. Using the output from `summary()`, write out the estimated regression line (recall:** $y = mx + b$).

y = 0.001141x + 88.57

**10. Do you have evidence to conclude there is a relationship between the median household income and the median weekly cost of center-based childcare for infants in California? Cite values from your `summary()` output to support your claim!**

The R\^2 value of 0.5178 means that 51.78% of the variability in median household income can be explained by the variability in the median weekly cost of center-based childcare. This statistic corresponds to a p-value of \<0.0001 meaning that I do have evidence that there is a relationship between the median household income and the median weekly cost of center-based childcare for infants in California. More specifically, because of the positive estimated slope between the two variables of 0.00141, as median household income increases, the median weekly cost of center-based childcare for infants also increases.
